# Map-Navigator
Graph Representation:

Locations are represented as nodes.
Roads between locations are represented as edges with distances.
Road conditions (traffic or blockages) are handled via a RoadCondition structure.
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:

Finds the shortest path from the start location to the end location.
Takes road conditions (traffic and blockages) into account.
User Input:

The user inputs the start and end locations.
The system calculates the shortest path and displays it.
