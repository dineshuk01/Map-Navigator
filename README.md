# Map-Navigator

Graph Representation:
Locations are represented as nodes.
Roads between locations are represented as edges with distances by users.
Road conditions (traffic or blockages) are handled via a RoadCondition structure userdefined.

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:
Finds the shortest path from the start location to the end location.
Takes road conditions (traffic and blockages) into account.

User Input:
The user inputs the start and end locations.
The system calculates the shortest path and displays it.
